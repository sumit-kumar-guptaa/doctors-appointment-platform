# Clerk Billing Error Fix

## Problem
The application was showing the following error:
```
ClerkRuntimeError: ðŸ”’ Clerk: The <PricingTable/> component cannot be rendered when billing is disabled.
```

## Root Cause
The `components/pricing.jsx` file was using Clerk's `<PricingTable />` component, but Clerk's billing/commerce feature was disabled in the dashboard.

## Solution Applied
1. **Replaced Clerk PricingTable**: Removed the `<PricingTable />` component from `components/pricing.jsx`
2. **Created Custom Pricing Component**: Built a custom pricing table with:
   - Three tiers: Basic (Free), Standard ($29/month), Premium ($59/month)
   - Credit-based pricing system (2 credits per consultation)
   - Modern UI with hover effects and "Most Popular" badge
   - Direct integration with sign-up links

3. **Updated Imports**: Removed unused `PricingTable` import from `app/(main)/pricing/page.jsx`

## Benefits of Custom Implementation
- âœ… No dependency on Clerk's billing feature
- âœ… Full control over pricing display and logic
- âœ… Consistent with app's design theme
- âœ… Easy to modify pricing plans and features
- âœ… Better integration with your credit system

## Files Modified
- `components/pricing.jsx` - Complete rewrite with custom pricing component
- `app/(main)/pricing/page.jsx` - Removed unused import

## How to Enable Clerk Billing (Optional)
If you later want to use Clerk's billing features:
1. Visit: https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=billing/settings
2. Enable commerce/billing feature
3. Configure your pricing plans in Clerk dashboard
4. Replace the custom component with `<PricingTable />` if desired

The application now works perfectly with the custom pricing implementation!
